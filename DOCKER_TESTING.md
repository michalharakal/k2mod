# j2mod Docker Testing Environment

This document provides an overview of the Docker testing environment for j2mod.

## Overview

The Docker testing environment allows you to test j2mod in a consistent and isolated environment. It provides two testing scenarios:

1. **Local Project Testing**: Tests the current project code
2. **Release Testing**: Tests against the released version of j2mod from Maven Central

## Files Created

- `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker image for testing the local project code
- `docker-compose.yml`: Orchestrates the Docker containers
- `test-scripts/run-release-tests.sh`: Script to test against the released version of j2mod
- `run-docker-tests.sh`: Convenience script for running the tests
- `docker-test-README.md`: Documentation for the Docker testing environment
- `test-results/`: Directory for storing test results

## How It Works

### Local Project Testing

The local project testing environment:
- Builds a Docker image with Java 11 and Maven
- Mounts the project directory into the container
- Runs the Maven tests on the project code

### Release Testing

The release testing environment:
- Uses a Java 11 image
- Creates a simple Maven project with j2mod as a dependency
- Runs a simple test to verify the functionality of the released version

## Usage

See the `docker-test-README.md` file for detailed usage instructions.

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Tests run in the same environment regardless of the host system
- **Isolation**: Tests don't interfere with the host system
- **Reproducibility**: Tests can be reproduced on any system with Docker
- **Comparison**: Easy to compare local code with the released version

## Future Improvements

Possible future improvements to the Docker testing environment:

1. Add support for testing against multiple versions of j2mod
2. Add support for testing against different Java versions
3. Add support for testing against different operating systems
4. Add support for testing against different Modbus devices
5. Add support for continuous integration
