This document tracks the progress of migrating the j2mod library from Java to Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) according to the phases outlined in the migration_tasks.md document.

## Migration Progress Summary

| Phase | Status | Start Date | Completion Date |
|-------|--------|------------|----------------|
| Phase 1: Project Setup and Initial Migration | Almost Complete | 2023-11-15 | - |
| Phase 2: Protocol Implementation Migration | Not Started | - | - |

### Phase 3: API and Facade Migration

#### 1. API Design
- [ ] Redesign the API to be more Kotlin-idiomatic
- [ ] Maintain Java compatibility
- [ ] Use Kotlin features like extension functions, coroutines, and flow

#### 2. Facade Implementation
- [ ] Migrate facade classes to provide a consistent API across platforms
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with Java code

#### 3. Platform-Specific Optimizations
- [ ] Implement iOS-specific optimizations
- [ ] Optimize JVM implementation to match or exceed original Java performance

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

#### 1. Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up testing framework for KMP
- [ ] Migrate existing tests to Kotlin
- [ ] Create platform-specific tests for platform-specific functionality

#### 2. Cross-Platform Testing
- [ ] Implement tests that verify consistent behavior across platforms
- [ ] Create integration tests that use Java implementation as reference

#### 3. Performance Testing
- [ ] Benchmark KMP implementation against original Java implementation
- [ ] Optimize performance bottlenecks

## Notes and Observations

### 2023-11-15
- Successfully set up the Kotlin Multiplatform project structure with JVM, iOS, and wasm targets
- Created build.gradle.kts with necessary dependencies and configurations for all platforms
- Updated settings.gradle.kts with project name and plugin repositories
- The project is now ready for the next phase of migration: dependency analysis and implementation

### 2023-11-16
- Completed dependency analysis and identified KMP-compatible alternatives
- Created cross-platform SerialConnection abstraction with expect/actual declarations
- Implemented platform-specific SerialConnection implementations for JVM, iOS, and JS
- Created a cross-platform logging interface using kotlin-logging
- Set up the directory structure according to the migration plan

### 2023-11-17
- Migrated core Modbus constants from Java interface to Kotlin object
- Migrated exception classes (ModbusException, ModbusIOException, ModbusSlaveException) to Kotlin
- Made Kotlin-idiomatic improvements such as using const val, when expressions, and string interpolation
- Ensured cross-platform compatibility for all migrated code

### 2023-11-18
- Migrated utility classes to Kotlin:
  - BitVector: Implemented a cross-platform bit collection with LSB/MSB access modes
  - ModbusUtil: Migrated utility methods for Modbus protocol operations (CRC calculation, data type conversions, etc.)
- Created stubs for dependencies:
  - BytesOutputStream: A stub implementation for byte array output stream
  - ModbusMessage: A stub interface for Modbus protocol messages
- Used Kotlin features like extension functions, companion objects, and string templates
- Implemented platform-independent alternatives to Java-specific functionality

### 2023-11-19
- Migrated more utility classes to Kotlin:
  - Observable: Implemented a cross-platform Observable pattern without Java-specific synchronization
  - Observer: Created the corresponding Observer interface for the Observable pattern
  - SerialParameters: Migrated the serial port parameters wrapper with platform-specific considerations
  - ThreadPool: Reimplemented using Kotlin coroutines and channels for cross-platform concurrency
- Created stubs for dependencies:
  - AbstractSerialConnection: A stub interface with constants for serial communication
- Used Kotlin features like properties with default values, when expressions, and string templates
- Handled platform-specific behavior (RS-485 support on Linux) with appropriate comments
- Improved code readability and maintainability with Kotlin's null safety features

### 2023-11-20
- Analyzed ModPoll utility class and decided to postpone its migration to Phase 2
  - ModPoll has dependencies on facade classes (AbstractModbusMaster, ModbusSerialMaster, etc.)
  - It also depends on process image classes (InputRegister, Register) that haven't been migrated yet
  - Migrating it now would require creating many stubs and placeholders
- Completed Phase 1 Core Data Structure Migration except for shared interfaces
  - Successfully migrated all basic data models, exception classes, and utility classes (except ModPoll)
  - Created cross-platform implementations that work on JVM, iOS, and JS targets
  - Used Kotlin-specific features to improve code quality and maintainability
- Ready to move on to implementing shared interfaces and beginning Phase 2

### 2023-11-21
- Implemented core TCP/IP functionality for Kotlin Multiplatform
  - Created ModbusRequest and ModbusResponse interfaces extending ModbusMessage
  - Implemented ModbusTransaction abstract class for handling Modbus transactions
  - Created AbstractModbusListener abstract class for handling incoming connections
  - Implemented TCPMasterConnection with platform-specific implementations for JVM, iOS, and JS
  - Created ModbusTCPTransport and ModbusTCPTransaction classes for JVM platform
  - Used expect/actual declarations for platform-specific network operations
- Made significant progress on Phase 2 Transport Layer Migration
  - Completed TCP/IP implementation for common code and JVM platform
  - Created stub implementations for iOS and JS platforms
  - Used Kotlin-specific features like nullable types and safe calls for more robust code
- Ready to continue with UDP and RTU over TCP implementations

## Next Steps

1. Implement shared interfaces for cross-platform components
2. Continue migrating protocol-specific code (Phase 2)
   - Migrate UDP implementation to common code
   - Migrate RTU over TCP implementation to common code
   - Create platform-specific implementations for Serial RTU and Serial ASCII
3. Begin API and Facade Migration (Phase 3)
   - Migrate facade classes (AbstractModbusMaster, ModbusSerialMaster, etc.)
   - Migrate process image classes (InputRegister, Register, etc.)
   - Migrate ModPoll utility class (postponed from Phase 1 due to dependencies)
4. Set up testing infrastructure for the migrated code
